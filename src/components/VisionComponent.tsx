            We are building a digital product, but that is just one piece of the
            puzzle. <br />
            <br />
            Where traditional solutions are formed around capital and companies,
            we base what we do on values, people, and community. We believe a
            more compassionate internet is only possible through a community
            driven approach. As founders, we will kickstart the community, but
            the goal is for it to grow into a self-sustaining entity where we we
            are members, not leaders. <br />
            <br />
            We can shape a better digital world - together. Join us!

            Giving and receiving love and appreciation, made fun with
            gamification, encouraging the ability to create and to monetize on
            the platform activities, while doing so in the context of a loving
            community. This is our end user value. <br />
            <br />

            digital solution that will do all of this.

            We will be bootstrapping the initiative through our own hard work
            and an open token sale to the community. See our tokenomics. We may
            also accept grants from other tech projects.We will not use VC
            financing as we believe this doesnÂ´t align to the project's values.

          <SectionTitle>Values</SectionTitle>
          <SectionText>
            The Love Project is ultimately about values. <br />
            <br />
            We believe in transparency, honesty and community. We care about our
            users and focus on the vision that our platform should make the
            world better, not worse. This is central, as it is what
            differentiates us from the dominating social media platforms. The
            project is initiated in northern Europe, and we confess to the
            traditional Scandinavian values of transparency, equality and
            fairness. We are not naive, as Web3 OGs we know the tech world is a
            minefield with regards to values of its actors. We navigate this to
            the best of our abilities, but acknowledge the challenge in this.
